# VPT-101: Open Source Vault-PETase Therapy for Plastic Detox 🌎

[![License: CC0-1.0](https://licensebuttons.net/p/zero/1.0/80x15.png)](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

## Mission Statement
We are releasing the world's first open-source nanoplastic detox therapy—for everyone, everywhere, forever. No paywalls. No patents. No restrictions. The world owns this.

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Download the Package:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/OpenPlasticDetox/VPT-101.git
```

**Review the Protocols:**
- `/protocols/` — Step-by-step bench protocols, loading, testing, clinical workflows

**Select Your Use Case:**
- **Research?** Start with `/protocols/vault_engineering_protocol.md`
- **Clinic?** See `/protocols/clinical_testing_roadmap.md`
- **DIY/education?** Try the plain-language `/media/VPT-101_explainer.pdf`

**Join the Community:**
- Matrix/Discord/Slack Invite
- Weekly "open lab" meetings, live support, instant feedback

## 🧬 What Is VPT-101?

- **Therapy:** Human cell vault nanoparticles loaded with humanized, plastic-eating enzymes (FAST-PETase + MHETase)
- **Target:** Blood, brain, placenta—where plastics build up
- **Action:** Breaks down PET nanoplastics into safe, excretable metabolites
- **Platform:** Modular—swap enzymes to tackle any plastic, any organ
- **Status:** Ready for global prototyping, improvement, and real-world testing
