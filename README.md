## 🌟 What is VPT-101?

**VPT-101 is the world's first comprehensive open-source platform for vault protein therapies** - making advanced medical treatments as accessible as open-source software. Just as Linux democratized computing, VPT-101 democratizes medicine.

### 🎯 Our Mission

**To eliminate healthcare inequity by making advanced medical technology accessible to everyone, everywhere, regardless of economic status or geographic location.**

We provide complete, free, and open access to:
- **Experimental Protocols**: Step-by-step instructions for vault protein expression and therapeutic loading
- **Genetic Sequences**: DNA constructs and engineering templates  
- **Software Tools**: Analysis pipelines and data processing tools
- **Regulatory Templates**: FDA submission frameworks and compliance guides
- **Community Support**: Global network of researchers and clinicians

## 🔬 What are Vault Proteins?

Vault proteins are naturally occurring nanoparticles that can be engineered to deliver therapeutic payloads with unprecedented precision. They represent a revolutionary approach to drug delivery and gene therapy.

### Key Advantages
- **Targeted Delivery**: Precise delivery to specific cell types
- **High Loading Capacity**: Can carry multiple therapeutic compounds
- **Biocompatible**: Naturally occurring in human cells
- **Stable**: Long shelf life and storage stability
- **Scalable**: Can be produced using standard laboratory equipment
