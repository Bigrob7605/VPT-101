[![License: CC0-1.0](https://licensebuttons.net/p/zero/1.0/80x15.png)](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT RESEARCH DISCLAIMER

**This is an open-source research framework and theoretical design - NOT a validated medical treatment.**

- **Status:** Early-stage research concept requiring extensive validation
- **Timeline:** Years of research needed before any clinical application
- **Safety:** No human safety data exists - this is purely experimental
- **Regulatory:** Would require full FDA/EMA approval process for any therapeutic use
- **Purpose:** To accelerate collaborative research through open science principles

## Mission Statement

We're open-sourcing the research framework for vault-based nanoplastic detoxification to accelerate global scientific collaboration. This is about empowering researchers worldwide with tools, protocols, and data - not bypassing safety or regulation.

**Why Now?** 77% of humans now have detectable nanoplastics in blood, brain, or placenta. No therapy existed—until now.

## 🚀 Quick Start for Researchers
