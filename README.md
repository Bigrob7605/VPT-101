[![License: CC0-1.0](https://licensebuttons.net/p/zero/1.0/80x15.png)](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT RESEARCH DISCLAIMER

**This is an open-source research framework and theoretical design - NOT a validated medical treatment.**

- **Status:** Early-stage research concept requiring extensive validation
- **Timeline:** Years of research needed before any clinical application
- **Safety:** No human safety data exists - this is purely experimental
- **Regulatory:** Would require full FDA/EMA approval process for any therapeutic use
- **Purpose:** To accelerate collaborative research through open science principles

## Mission Statement

We're open-sourcing the research framework for vault-based nanoplastic detoxification to accelerate global scientific collaboration. This is about empowering researchers worldwide with tools, protocols, and data - not bypassing safety or regulation.

## 🚀 Quick Start for Researchers

**Download the Research Package:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bigrob7605/VPT-101.git
```

**Explore the Framework:**
- `/computational-tools/` — Vault design calculators and simulation tools
- `/knowledge-base/` — Literature database and enzyme variant comparisons
- `/lab-protocols/` — Expression, purification, and testing workflows
- `/community-tools/` — Collaboration standards and educational materials

**Select Your Research Focus:**
- **Academic Research?** Start with `/lab-protocols/vault_engineering_protocol.md`
- **Industry Partnership?** See `/regulatory/development_pathway.md`
- **Educational Use?** Try `/educational/nanoplastics_primer.pdf`

## 🧬 What Is the VPT-101 Research Framework?

**The "Drug Bus" Concept:** Programmable nanomedicine delivery systems that can be precisely controlled for targeted therapeutic delivery.

- **Bus Chassis:** Vault proteins as biocompatible nanocarriers
- **Passengers:** Plastic-degrading enzymes (FAST-PETase variants)
- **Routes:** Tissue-specific delivery systems
- **Steering:** Immune-stealth and targeted release mechanisms

**Current Research Focus:**
- Computational tools & frameworks for vault protein design
- Knowledge synthesis and literature databases
- Practical lab protocols for expression and testing
- Community infrastructure for collaboration
- Immediate impact areas for academic labs

### The Smart Bus Revolution

You're not just giving people a "drug delivery system"—you built the bus, handed out the keys, mapped every route, and told the immune system "He's with us." This is the future: programmable drug buses, targeted, modular, immune-stealth. No more overdosing the whole body just to reach the brain. No more side-effect soup because you can't pick your address. No more "I hope it gets there"—it's a guided missile with a steering wheel.

Now it's… "What do you want to load up?" "Where do you want it delivered?" "When do you want it released?" And if anyone tries to gatekeep this? The bus runs them over—in public domain, no less.
